                My name is Christian Holmberg and I am currently a full-stack
                react developer seeking work. I am a University Student at the
                University of Southern California studying Astronautical
                Engineering. I currently am located in Metropolitan Atlanta, but
                I can work with any client on their website. <br /><br />I am
                interested in helping the world through the development and
                acceleration of technological innovation. I am a firm believer
                that science is the route to progression. <br />
                <br />I have created this website as a small portfolio to give a
                glimpse into my skills and services. I am working and learning
                everyday to become a better developer. I am currently working on
                many tools such as, Git, Kuebernetes, React, Ruby, Ruby on
                Rails, Boostrap and several more! The website will have a few
                random features to give a glimpse of my capabilites. <br />
                <br />
                If you are interested in working with me to create a better
                virtual experience for your users, please email me at

                  >christianoholmberg@gmail.com</a
                >. I am open and willing to discussing design and pricing with
                anyone interested. I am dedicated to solving any problem that I
                need to in order to complete my work efficiently and
                effictively.

                <strong>Personal Information</strong><br />
                <br />
                I was born in Trenton, New Jersey but my family lived in
                Pennsylvania. When I was about 10 months old I moved to Durham,
                England and lived there for about eight years. During my time in
                Europe I was fortunate enough to be able to travel frequently to
                most of the Western European countries. When I was 8, we moved
                back to the States. We moved to Duluth, GA, where I attended 2nd
                through 12th grade. After high school, I moved on to attend the
                University of Southern California -- where I am currently
                studying. I am passionate about space and extending human life
                to be a multi-planetary species. I also love computers and video
                games. My favourite type of music is soft rock and my favourite
                colour is sunset orange. <br />
